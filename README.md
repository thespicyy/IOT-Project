# Power Bi dashboard to monitor data
We have deployed several devices equipped with sensors across various rice fields in Minami-Aso in Kumamoto. This dashboard enables us to monitor the data and verify the operational status of our sensors.

# For the future
Our future objective is to develop a neural network that identifies the optimal times for irrigation and fertilization. This will help optimize rice growth, ultimately enabling farmers to increase their yield.
